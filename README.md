# prednote

prednote helps you build a tree of predicates that you can apply to
a list of items.  It was written for Penny:

http://www.github.com/massysett/penny

but I also find it useful for dapi:

http://www.github.com/massysett/dapi

and so you might find it useful too.

prednote is on Github:

http://www.github.com/massysett/prednote

and Hackage:

http://hackage.haskell.org/package/prednote

## Versioning

prednote releases are numbered in accordance with the Haskell
Package Versioning Policy.

prednote does not set its dependencies in accordance with the
Package Versioning Policy, as I do not set upper bounds.  prednote
is guaranteed to build with the *minimum* versions specified in the
cabal file.  I also include a dependencies.txt file that
documents more recent dependencies that are also known to work.

If you find that prednote does not build due to dependency problems:
1) please let me know at omari@smileystation.com; 2) feel free to
add appropriate upper bounds or patches to the package as
appropriate; and 3) feel free to add command-line contraints to your
cabal command to get it to build.
