# prednote

prednote helps you build a tree of predicates that you can apply to
a list of items.  It was written for Penny:

http://www.github.com/massysett/penny

but I also find it useful for dapi:

http://www.github.com/massysett/dapi

and so you might find it useful too.

prednote is on Github:

http://www.github.com/massysett/prednote

and Hackage:

## Test results

You can view the results of building and testing on Travis by clicking
the button below:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/massysett/prednote.svg?branch=v0.26.0.4)](https://travis-ci.org/massysett/prednote)

If you have trouble building prednote due to dependency issues, try
looking at the previous test results, as they will show you package
versions that were used to build prednote successfully.
