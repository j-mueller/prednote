# prednote

prednote helps you build a tree of predicates that you can apply to
a list of items.  It was written for Penny:

http://www.github.com/massysett/penny

but I also find it useful for dapi:

http://www.github.com/massysett/dapi

and so you might find it useful too.

prednote is on Github:
